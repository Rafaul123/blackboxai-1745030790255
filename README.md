# Network Detector App

## Project Overview
The **Network Detector App** is a desktop application designed to detect web and device network activity for compromise detection. This application utilizes Electron to create a cross-platform desktop interface and simulates network monitoring to track potentially suspicious activity on the network.

## Installation
To install and run the Network Detector App, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/network-detector-app.git
   cd network-detector-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage
Once the application is running, it will continuously simulate network data generation every two seconds. You will see the network activity being logged in the console, indicating whether any suspicious or dangerous activity is detected on the network.

The application can be used to monitor:
- Packet details such as source and destination IPs, protocols, and length.
- Alerts for suspicious, dangerous, or hazardous network activity.

## Features
- Real-time network activity simulation.
- Detection of potentially dangerous network packets based on customizable rules.
- Console output of network traffic with detailed descriptions including threat levels.
- Summary of network packets every 10 minutes.

## Dependencies
The application relies on the following key dependencies defined in `package.json`:

- **Electron**: ^25.3.1
- **pcap**: ^2.1.0

In addition to the runtime dependencies, the following development dependencies are included:

- **@babel/core**: ^7.22.9
- **@babel/preset-react**: ^7.22.5
- **babel-loader**: ^9.1.3
- **react**: ^18.2.0
- **react-dom**: ^18.2.0
- **webpack**: ^5.88.2
- **webpack-cli**: ^5.1.4
